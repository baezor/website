I should have written this post yesterday, and for a moment, I felt awful. I should have put it on my schedule. I intended to do it at night but fell asleep early. However, the next morning I didn't feel bad because I really enjoyed a long, good night's sleep - I needed it. Past me would have been angry at myself for skipping it, but I've learned to be compassionate with myself, and also learned that progress is not always linear.

We should remember that skipping a day is not necessarily bad and doesn't ruin everything.

Yes, in order to gain a skill or create a good habit, we should strive to do it every day. But I think it is also important to practice resilience when something unexpected comes our way.

Be patient with yourself if you can’t do it today. Practice resilience and discipline, but also practice compassion with yourself. If you didn't do it today, do it tomorrow - that’s fine.
