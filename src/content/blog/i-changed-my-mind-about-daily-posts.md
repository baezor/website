Jesus, I stopped writing an entire month!

My goal was to journal everyday. I wanted to put some thoughts, ideas, or showcase things I'm working on. I really wanted to do it. But life is hard and unpredictable, which is good and I already accept that you don't through life in a linear path.

I decided to stop the daily writing and starting publishing once per week so I can deliver high-quality posts.

My next blog post is about an AI-based recipes creator I'm building. The recipes are generated based on what foods you have in your kitchen and if you're on a diet, based on the proportions you need to follow. The app is simple, but I think is gonna help people.

Projects, meetings, code, decisions, emergencies, house maintenance, the list is big, but I won't let all these things stopping me from what I should really do, to write.

See you next week!

A.
