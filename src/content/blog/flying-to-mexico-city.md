I like to be at the airport at least a couple of hours earlier to sit in the lounge, grab a cup of coffee and write some code or finish work.

I'm flying to Mexico City today. I don't miss the city, but I do miss my family. I'm excited to see them again.

It wasn't a productive day at work because I had to take care of the house and pack my bags.

I downloaded a recording of a talk between P Marca and someone else that I don't remember. I'll listen to it on the plane.

No progress on personal projects either, and probably I won't touch any code until I get back.

And that's okay. Remember to not being too hard on yourself. It's okay to take a break and enjoy life.

But I don't want to skip my daily writing, so I'll be here tomorrow.

I'm boarding now. See you tomorrow.
