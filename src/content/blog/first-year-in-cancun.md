A year ago, I moved to Cancun, M√©xico. My girlfriend and I moved there to start a new chapter in our lives, and also it has been a year of personal growth and self-discovery.

I never imagined I would be living near the sea. The only thing I did know it was that I didn't want to stay in my hometown, I wanted to live in a different city.

Cancun has given me a quality of life that I never thought I would have. Quiet mornings, beautiful sunsets, and the sound of the waves.

But sometimes I miss the city life, the noise, the hustle, and the energy. But I don't know if I would go back to the city. I don't see myself living in a city again.

I'm grateful for the life I have here, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.

Cheers for the new beginnings. üçª
