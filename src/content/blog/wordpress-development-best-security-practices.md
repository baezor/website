Today's post will cover WordPress security.

While it's a great platform for building websites, it's also a popular target for hackers. Here are some best practices I follow to keep WordPress sites secure.

## Basic Security Practices

1. Update WordPress, themes, and plugins weekly or even daily if possible, and remove any that are not in use.
2. Use strong passwords and PLEASE use a password manager.
3. Avoid using popular pagebuilders like Elementor, Divi, or WPBakery. I've seen sites get hacked because of these plugins. Try to use Gutenberg or create your custom theme.

## Development Security Practices

4. Any output should be escaped. `esc_url()` all the things.
5. When there's a WordPress function, use it. Don't reinvent the wheel.
6. Always use `$wpdb` functions
7. Use `$wpdb->prepare()` to escape SQL queries.
8. Use nonces to protect forms.

## Helpful Resources for WordPress Security

- [WordPress Security](https://wordpress.org/support/article/hardening-wordpress/) Your bible if you're taking WordPress security seriously.
- [Theme Handbook Security](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/security/) If you're a theme developer, this is a must-read, (which my post covers all of it).
